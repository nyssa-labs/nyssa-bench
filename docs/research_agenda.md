# Research Agenda

NyssaBench's north star:

> NyssaBench is foundational because it standardizes embodied AI evaluation. It
> is frontier because it evaluates the hardest current robot-policy failures:
> robustness, sim-to-real, real-to-sim, and VLA reliability.

## First Paper Framing

Working title:

> NyssaBench: Failure-Aware and Audit-Safe Evaluation for Frontier Embodied AI
> Policies

Subtitle:

> A foundational benchmark framework for stress-testing, comparing, and
> debugging robot policies under real-world variation.

## Core Contributions

1. Simulator-agnostic `TaskSpec` and adapter interfaces for embodied policy
   evaluation.
2. Failure taxonomy and mapper for manipulation and embodied policy failures.
3. Stressor protocol for physical, visual, language, and control perturbations.
4. Result-tier system that prevents overclaiming benchmark results.
5. Pairwise Arena Mode for blinded policy comparison under identical
   conditions.
6. Replay-first reports with failure evidence.
7. Failure-episode export for retraining workflows.
8. Initial video-backed ManiSkill result pack with random, scripted, and learned
   baselines.

## Build Order

1. Keep the foundational protocol docs and validation APIs stable.
2. Make the ManiSkill result pack video-backed.
3. Improve the scripted/planner baseline until it solves the tasks reliably.
4. Train or evaluate a learned baseline that clearly beats random.
5. Add pairwise arena reporting on top of validated run artifacts.
6. Add stress-search and real-to-sim experiments only after the v0.1 result is
   credible.

## What Not To Build First

- new simulator engines
- cloud dashboards
- leaderboard websites
- OpenVLA-first demos
- humanoid-first benchmarks
- real-to-sim reconstruction
- world-model simulators

Those are future layers. The immediate bottleneck is trustworthy video-backed
evaluation.
